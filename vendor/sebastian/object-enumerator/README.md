## Installation

<<<<<<< HEAD
To add Object Enumerator as a local, per-project dependency to your project, simply add a dependency on `sebastian/object-enumerator` to your project's `composer.json` file. Here is a minimal example of a `composer.json` file that just defines a dependency on Object Enumerator 1.0:

    {
        "require": {
            "sebastian/object-enumerator": "~1.0"
        }
    }
=======
You can add this library as a local, per-project dependency to your project using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```
composer require sebastian/object-enumerator
```

If you only need this library during development, for instance to run your project's test suite, then you should add it as a development-time dependency:

```
composer require --dev sebastian/object-enumerator
```
