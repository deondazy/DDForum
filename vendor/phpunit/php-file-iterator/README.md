# File_Iterator

## Installation

To add File_Iterator as a local, per-project dependency to your project, simply add a dependency on `phpunit/php-file-iterator` to your project's `composer.json` file. Here is a minimal example of a `composer.json` file that just defines a dependency on File_Iterator 1.4:

    {
        "require": {
            "phpunit/php-file-iterator": "~1.4"
        }
    }

# php-file-iterator

## Installation

You can add this library as a local, per-project dependency to your project using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

    composer require phpunit/php-file-iterator

If you only need this library during development, for instance to run your project's test suite, then you should add it as a development-time dependency:

    composer require --dev phpunit/php-file-iterator
